Note that the gears can be dragged.
The changes will become visible after a `mouseup` event (the code was written in a hurry and has some loose ends.)

## About
The project was written as part of a challenge for a JavaScript meetup: [JSMD challenge](https://github.com/JSMD/challenges/blob/master/challenge%20%233/README.md).

## Building
The project doesn't use any preprocessor so all that is needed is maybe a small server. `http-server` from `npm` was the one I used.
